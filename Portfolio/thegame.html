    <p>This is the game i have worked on. It is a game in which the aim is to collect the collectable items which in this case are keys and get a score of 100. each key is worth 25 points. Once the player gets a score of 100 they can go to the flagpole which would give them a Level complete message. If on the way they fall into one of the canyons they will lose one of their lives. They can avoid this by jumping over them. If they lose all their lives they will recieve a game over message. </p>
